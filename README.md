# Northwest Sports Team Colors

These are hex codes and CSS classes for the colors of the sports team I follow
in the Pacific Northwest. There's a CSS and SCSS file, depending on which
you prefer.

## Usage

The classes roughly follow [BEM syntax](http://getbem.com/introduction/). The
pattern is `.team--priority` for colors, and `.team__background--priority` for
backgrounds. Retro colors get an additional element modifier, like `.team__retro__background--priority`.

For example:

```
.mariners--primary
.mariners__background--tertiary
.mariners__retro__background--secondary
```

## Teams

- Portland Trail Blazers
- Seattle Mariners
- Seattle Seahawks
- Washington Huskies

## Source

I found all of these on [teamcolorcodes.com](https://teamcolorcodes.com).

Feel free to make PR for your favorite NW team. Or, any other team, as long as
everything's organized reasonably.
