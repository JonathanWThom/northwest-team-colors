# Northwest Sports Team Colors

These are hex codes and CSS classes for the colors of the sports team I follow
in the Pacific Northwest. There's a CSS and SCSS file, depending on which
you prefer.

## Teams

- Portland Trail Blazers
- Seattle Mariners
- Seattle Seahawks
- Washington Huskies

## Source

I found all of these on [teamcolorcodes.com](https://teamcolorcodes.com).

Feel free to make PR for your favorite NW team. Or, any other team, as long as
everything's organized reasonably.
